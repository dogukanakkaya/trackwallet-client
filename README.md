I was feeling lazy to check each cryptocurrency wallet from different places like **Solflare for SOL** and **Firefly for IOTA** since i use a hardware wallet instead of an exchange or something. With this app, i use a firestore database to keep my assets and it's wallet data and fetch balance of my assets and the prices from CoinMarketCap to collect them at one place.
